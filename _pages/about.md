Bio
------
I am an R&D research scientist in the Computer Vision team at FittingBox in Toulouse, France. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse in 2020. Before joining FittingBox, I worked with Mikros Image during my PhD and postdoctoral research.
My primary research interest is in inverse problems in computer vision, especially 3D reconstruction, and their solution using variational methods and deep learning.
